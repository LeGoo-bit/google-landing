          There’s no debate: Our bodies need protein to function. But in recent
          years, popular weight-loss plans have spotlighted this nutrient as the
          most important part of your diet. So what’s the deal? While there’s no
          magic pill for weight loss or overall health, high-protein foods
          should be an essential component of your daily meals and snacks,
          explains Jaclyn London, MS, RD, CDN, head of nutrition and wellness at
          WW. “By eating protein consistently throughout your day, you’re
          automatically making more satisfying food choices that will help you
          feel energized and stay fuller, longer—which may also help minimize
          between-meal grazing,” she says. We tapped WW’s nutrition experts to
          shed more light on why protein is so important, how it relates to
          weight management, and some of the best sources of protein. Here’s the
          lowdown on 15 protein-rich foods, plus 43 delicious recipes to try:

        <br />
        <h3>The importance of protein-rich foods</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          <br />
          Proteins are one of three macronutrients (along with carbohydrates and
          fats) that our bodies need to work, explains Angela Goscilo, MS, RD,
          CDN, nutrition manager at WW. “These provide us with energy and serve
          as building blocks for muscles and tissues,” she adds. Simply put,
          protein helps power nearly every system in the body—from strengthening
          bones, muscles, and cartilage to helping cell tissues repair and
          regenerate. High-protein foods are so important because they contain
          essential amino acids that our bodies rely on—and can only get from
          food. Protein itself is made of 20 amino acids, and while the human
          body can produce 11 of these on its own, the remaining nine must come
          from our diets. Not to mention, many protein-rich foods also contain
          other key nutrients, such as B vitamins (like niacin, vitamin B12,
          vitamin B6, and riboflavin), selenium, choline, phosphorus, zinc,
          copper, vitamin D, vitamin A, and vitamin E, depending on the food.
          While our bodies need micronutrients like vitamins and minerals in
          smaller amounts, protein is something we need in larger quantities.
          Here’s where things get a little tricky: There’s no one-size-fits-all
          recommendation on how many grams of protein you should eat. (This is
          why you won’t see a percent daily value for protein on nutrition facts
          labels.) The current recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein
          is 0.8 grams per kg of bodyweight—just over 7 grams of protein per 20
          pounds. Meaning? A person who weighs 150 pounds needs about 55 grams
          protein per day. That said, most of us are consuming more protein than
          our baseline needs, according to London. “So as a dietitian, I’d
          rather you focus on eating various protein-containing food rather than
          the nutrient itself,” she adds.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Which foods are high in protein?</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          When you think of protein-rich foods, you likely picture meat and
          other animal products. And you’re right! But while red meat, poultry,
          and eggs are good sources of protein—meaning they are complete
          proteins that contain all nine amino acids our bodies need from
          food—they’re not the only ones. Plant-based proteins are great
          additions to any diet—regardless of whether you’re vegan or
          vegetarian. Research suggests that replacing some animal proteins with
          plant-based sources could have positive health benefits: A 2019 study
          published in the Journal of the American College Of Cardiology linked
          the consumption of a mostly plant-based diet to a 41% lower risk of
          developing heart failure. Meanwhile, a 2014 meta-analysis of 37
          studies published in JAMA Internal Medicine linked vegetarian, vegan,
          or semi-vegetarian diets (i.e., when you eat some meat, eggs, fish, or
          dairy) with lower blood pressure. Most plant-based sources don’t
          contain all nine essential amino acids, but there’s a simple solution:
          Eat a variety! The most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans
          recommends aiming for five and a half 1-ounce servings (or equivalent)
          of protein per day. What does that look like? One small steak is about
          4 ounces, a can of tuna is 3-4 ounces, three eggs (whites and yolks)
          clock in at 3 ounces, and ¼ cup of cooked beans, chickpeas, or lentils
          is equal to a 1-oz serving. Regardless of your eating style, there are
          so many delicious (and surprising!) protein-rich foods to add to your
          diet. Check out some of the best sources of protein:

        <h2>1. Chicken breast</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Chicken is a staple in many diets and for good reason! It’s a great
          source of protein, lower in saturated fat than some red and processed
          meats, and it packs a nutrient-dense mix of unsaturated fatty acids,
          vitamins, and minerals. For the leanest cut with the most protein, opt
          for grilled skinless chicken breast or skinless rotisserie chicken
          breast—one <a href="">3-oz serving </a> delivers 26 grams of protein
          and 2.7 grams of saturated fat. You’ll also get key nutrients like
          <a href="">selenium</a> (which supports the immune system) and
          <a href="">choline</a> , which plays a role in memory, mood, muscle
          control, and heart health. <br /><br />

        <p>
          From <a href="">burgers</a> to BBQ, <a href="">beef</a> is a mainstay
          in many recipes. When it comes to protein, a 4-oz portion of
          <a href="">90% lean ground beef</a> contains 23 grams. Keep in mind,
          ground beef and other red meats are often higher in
          <a href="">unhealthy saturated fats</a> than other protein sources,
          London says. “You can still enjoy beef, just aim to add a mix of other

        <br />
        <p>
          Nutritionally, one <a href="">5-oz salmon filet</a> provides up to 27
          grams of protein and is packed with
          <a href="">heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids</a> in their most
          bioavailable form (aka the most useful to your body). Salmon is also
          an excellent source of potassium and vitamins B6 and B12, and
          naturally provides vitamins A and D. Most Americans aren’t eating
          <a href="">enough seafood</a>, according to the <a href="">USDA</a>.
          (For reference, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend eating
          a variety of seafood for a total of at least 8 ounces per week.)
          Salmon is a great way to help hit that target—enjoy it on your
          <a href="">morning bagel</a>, in
          <a href="">pasta, baked with veggies</a>, or even as a

        <br />
        <p>
          Canned tuna is a great source of vitamin D and omega-3’s, and as a
          shelf-stable lean protein source, it can’t be beat for convenience!
          One 3-oz serving of tuna in water (half a can) delivers around 16
          grams of protein. You’ll also get other key nutrients, including
          potassium, selenium, and calcium. Canned tuna can often get a bad rep
          because of mercury concerns, but this mostly applies to white
          (albacore) tuna. That said, the FDA recommends limiting this type to 6
          ounces per week or about one can, but light tuna and other types of
          canned, fresh, or frozen seafood can all help you get closer to the
          goal of at least 8 ounces of fish per week. <br /><br /><br />

        <br />
        <p>
          Shrimp, or prawns, are a delicious addition to many dishes and are
          packed with omega-3s and protein. Three ounces of cooked shrimp
          deliver 20 grams of protein. Shrimp often gets a bad rep due to its
          cholesterol levels, which are higher than other seafood options at 189
          milligrams per 3-oz serving. However, recent research shows there’s no
          evidence to suggest that dietary cholesterol can increase risk of
          cardiovascular disease. The actual dietary culprit? Saturated fat.
          Shrimp has 0 grams of saturated fat per serving, making it a lean
          source of protein and a heart-healthy meat alternative.

        <br />
        <p>
          While no single food you eat can make or break your health, eggs are
          considered one of the best sources of protein available, London says.
          They’re inexpensive, readily-available, nutrient-dense, and super
          versatile. A complete protein, one large egg contains 6 grams of
          protein. They’re also rich in choline, vitamins A and B12, and are one
          of the few foods that are natural sources of vitamin D.

        <br />
        <p>
          Even though they’re not technically categorized as protein-rich foods
          by the USDA, milk and other dairy products are standout sources. One
          cup of whole milk provides 8 grams of protein. And since cow’s milk is
          often fortified with vitamin D and A in the U.S., you’re automatically
          getting some of these important nutrients by adding a splash to your
          morning coffee, using it as an oatmeal ingredient, or sipping on a
          cold cup of it post-workout. In fact, consuming a combination of
          protein and carbs after an intense workout may help improve muscle
          recovery. Despite being made from protein-rich nuts and seeds,
          plant-based milks (like almond, soy, or cashew) have lower protein
          levels. If you can’t tolerate lactose, soy milk typically has the
          highest protein content at 7–8 grams per serving.

        <h2>8. Cheese</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Cheese is a delicious way to add flavor to nearly any dish, and let’s
          face it, what doesn’t taste better with a little cheese? The addition
          can infuse your meals with extra protein and nutrients like calcium,
          magnesium, and potassium. Based on the USDA portion guidelines, ⅓ cup
          of part-skim mozzarella delivers up to 9 grams of protein, a cup of
          low-sodium cottage cheese has 20 grams, and full fat, hard cheese like
          Parmesan packs 10 grams of protein per 1-oz serving. Like beef and
          other red and processed meat, cheese is a source of saturated fat.
          “The added benefit to full-fat hard cheeses is that they typically
          have stronger flavors, so you may find yourself using less,” London
          says. “This means you’ll still get the taste without overloading on
          saturated fat.”

        <br />
        <p>
           Greek yogurt Plain Greek
          yogurt is one of the most useful dairy-aisle finds—you can swap it for
          sour cream in dips or mayo in chicken salad; use it as a baking
          ingredient; add it to smoothies; or enjoy straight-up with fruit,
          nuts, or nut butter for a satisfying breakfast or snack. Unflavored
          nonfat Greek yogurt delivers 20 grams of protein per 7-oz serving.
          You’ll also hit 25% of the recommended daily intake of calcium with
          each serving. Once you’ve found your favorite way to enjoy it,
          experiment with plain natural yogurt and tangy skyr. While skyr is
          nutritionally similar to Greek yogurt, it’s actually a strained cheese
          made from skim milk.

        <p>
          Lentils are part of the powerhouse food group known as pulses—the dry, 
          edible seed of beans, lentils, chickpeas, and peas. Pulses aren’t just
          great sources of plant-based protein: They’re packed with fiber,
          minerals, and B vitamins. Nutritionally, ½ cup serving of cooked 
          lentils provides 8 grams of protein. Eating lentils (and other pulses) as a 
          part of a healthy pattern of eating has been linked to reducing risk of chronic disease, such as heart disease, type-2 diabetes, and some cancers.

        <p>While most of us can hit our protein goals through whole-food sources, there are some scenarios where protein powders or other protein-enriched foods can be useful. People starting an intense endurance- or strength-training program, recovering from surgery, or dealing with other health issues may need to boost their protein intake, says London. In these situations, be sure to talk with your health care provider to create a personalized nutrition plan. <br><br>

          That said, there may also be more in-the-moment times where you need some extra help on the protein front. On busy mornings where you barely have time to brush your teeth let alone cook breakfast, WW’s protein-packed lattes can be a great solution. Each 8-oz can provides 11 g of protein (from milk and milk protein isolate) and 20% of the Daily Value for calcium—making them convenient and nutritious breakfast additions. Ultimately, all foods are on the menu and WW members should do what works for them, which could include using a protein powder or protein-enhanced drinks, says Goscilo.</p>

        <h1>High-protein foods and weight loss</h1>
        <p>High-protein foods can be helpful when it comes to weight loss because of protein’s effect on satiety, i.e., how full and satisfied you feel after eating. Research suggests that protein is the most filling macronutrient, followed by carbs and then fat. Plus, the body uses more calories to digest protein: “It takes more work to break protein into smaller amino acids that can be absorbed,” Goscilo explains. While additional research is needed to determine exactly how this process helps you feel fuller, longer, it does. That means you may be less likely to eat between meals. 

          Ultimately, there’s no ideal macronutrient profile for weight loss, but eating protein-rich foods may also help preserve muscle mass during your weight-loss journey. Muscle is lost on most weight-loss programs; however, according to a 2013 study, higher protein intake helps preserve lean body mass. Research also suggests that it may be better for muscle health to consume a moderate amount of protein at each meal throughout the day rather than packing the entire goal amount into one.</p>
        <h1>Popular high-protein diets</h1>
        <p>In the average diet of an otherwise healthy person, protein can account for 10–35% of daily calories, according to the Institute of Medicine. This wide range means there’s conflicting opinions on what exactly constitutes a high-protein diet. However, the upper limit of protein intake is more clear: A 2006 review in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism defines excessive protein intake as anything above 35% of daily calories, and suggests it could lead to potential health risks like increased insulin levels, digestion issues, and more. The same study links a plan where 25% of calories come from protein to weight loss—without potential risks of overconsumption.

          The majority of protein-focused diets are also low-carb, and weight-loss plans touting the benefits of this approach have been around for decades. (The Atkins diet, for instance, was first developed in the 1960s.) While the recommended carb amounts differ, they typically call for eating less than 45–65% of daily calories from carbohydrates. Research has found low-carb diets effective for weight loss, but since these plans can be restrictive, people may find them difficult to adhere to long-term. Plus, a 2012 clinical trial published in Physiology & Behavior found that the success of these programs depends on the high-protein element, not the low-carb one. <br><br>
          
          Here’s the lowdown on other popular high-protein diet plans:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ketogenic diet: Also known as “keto,” this program is often grouped in with high-protein diets, but it’s actually more of a high-fat diet. The standard ketogenic diet recommends 70% calories come from fat, 20% from protein, and 10% from carbs.</li>
            <li>Paleo diet: This plan takes inspiration from our prehistoric ancestors and relies on foods presumed to be available during the Stone Age. You’ll get protein from lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, nuts, and seeds. Fruit, vegetables, and herbs are allowed, but the diet nixes other protein-rich foods like dairy, grains, beans, and legumes.</li>
            <li>Zone Diet: Originally developed to reduce inflammation, this program recommends that you get 30% of daily calories from protein, 40% from carbs, and 30% from fats.
            </li>
            <li>Carnivore diet: Like its name suggests, this diet instructs you to eat only animal products. Meat, poultry, eggs, and certain dairy products are permitted, but that’s where the list ends. Unlike the other plans that recommend a lower carb intake, this one (backed by no scientific studies) aims for zero carbs.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>How you build your plate on any high-protein diet is critical since some of the more restrictive eating plans could have negative health implications. For instance, opt for protein-rich foods that are too high in fat, and you may experience nausea, diarrhea, and other unpleasant side effects. On the other hand, replace too many nutrient- and fiber-rich foods (like fruit, veggies, and whole-grains) with high-protein ones in an effort to limit carbs and you could deal with constipation or micronutrient deficiencies. 

            “Any attempt to omit entire food groups or limit intake of a specific food group or category of nutrients comes at the cost of your long-term health,” London says. “An approach to weight loss that, by design, limits your intake of the most nutrient-dense foods on the planet like veggies and fruit can come with adverse physiological and biochemical side effects, which may make losing and maintaining weight even more difficult.”
            
            </p>
      </div>
      <div class="div3">
        <h1>The bottom line: Are you eating enough high-protein foods?</h1>
        <p>In this case, the better question might be are you eating enough types of protein-rich foods? After all, according to a 2018 analysis published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, most adults exceed the recommended intake of protein—consuming an average of 88 grams a day. As we said before, there’s no one-size-fits-all recommended protein intake. But for comparison, most women need around 46 grams of protein per day, and men need 56 grams, according to the USDA’s recent dietary guidelines. You may be getting enough of the macronutrient, not all sources are created equal—proteins can be lean or high in saturated fats. 

          Case in point: The amount of protein in a pork chop and piece of salmon are similar, but the pork has more than three times the saturated fat. Similarly, beef and certain cheeses are typically higher in saturated fat, which can raise bad cholesterol (LDL) levels and have been linked to increased risk of heart disease or stroke. Current guidelines recommend limiting saturated fat intake, but that doesn’t mean you have to revamp your entire eating style. Instead, consider incorporating more healthy fats (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated) found in nuts, seeds, and seafood to your diet. 
          
          Fats can be part of a healthy pattern of eating, along with various protein sources. It’s all about finding a balance, London says. Try adding more plant-based and lean protein sources into your diet by designating one meatless meal a day, swapping ground beef for turkey or chicken the next time you make chili, or opting for seafood a couple nights a week. <br><br>
